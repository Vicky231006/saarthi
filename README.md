## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/saarthi-final.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd saarthi-final
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The application is currently structured within a single, comprehensive `src/App.js` component. This file contains the state management, routing logic, and UI for all pages and sub-components.

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html      # Main HTML template
│   └── saarthilogo.jpg # Project logo
├── src/
│   ├── App.js          # Main application component
│   ├── index.css       # Tailwind CSS setup
│   └── index.js        # Application entry point
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

For future development and better maintainability, refactoring the distinct pages (e.g., `LandingPage`, `Dashboard`, `HackathonsPage`) and reusable components (e.g., `GlassCard`, `Navigation`) into their own separate files within a `components` and `pages` directory is highly recommended.
